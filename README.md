# OEE_Project
Repository for "Formal Definitions of Unbounded Evolution and Innovation Reveal Universal Mechanisms for Open-Ended Evolution in Dynamical Systems"

The main repository can be found at this Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1Js_WbwLxBjNGtla2tPVHRNWUU&usp=sharing

The code used to generate everything is in a Mathematica named Final_OEE_Exp1.nb. Each section of the code is labeled with a dropdown title. 
Data files needed may need to be moved to the code's current directory.
Images were generated in Mathematica, and edited in Photoshop.

Additional code can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B1Js_WbwLxBjflZXUzhaQWx5OUYxSmx2bllzSnA1c0hhT1ZUOFVTRG84OXM4Rk1OS2p5cmM
